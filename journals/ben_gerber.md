# 1-5-23

Started working on back-end, routes and queries for movies
Worked with Jesse and Mike, Jesse was the driver and Mike and I were the navigators
Had trouble getting connection to the database with proper username and password, was resolved by delting the volume and rebuilding the container

# 1-6-23

Finished CRUD for the movie_groups
Had some challenges where some things were dictionaries and others were custom objects, there still seem to be a mix of both but a mix that works

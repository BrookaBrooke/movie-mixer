Started working on back-end, routes and queries for movies
Worked with Jesse and Mike, Jesse was the driver and Mike and I were the navigators
Had trouble getting connection to the database with proper username and password, was resolved by delting the volume and rebuilding the container

# 1-6-23

Finished CRUD for the movie_groups
Had some challenges where some things were dictionaries and others were custom objects, there still seem to be a mix of both but a mix that works

# 1-9-23

Created a front end view for the movie groups with a page for a list of movie groups and a page with a form to add a new movie group

# 1-10-23

Updated the list view for movie groups so that the user can add a new group on the list page instead of a seperate page and got rid of the seperate form page.
Also added delete and edit buttons to the list

# 1-11-23

The list view wasn't actually working properly, I did not test it thoroughly enough. I fixed those problems today.

# 1-12-23

Today I worked on the "Add to list" button functionality on the MovieDetail.js page. I've gotten the basics to work, but I need to add a way to check if a movie is already in a group.
I also need to make it so the user can choose which group to add it to.

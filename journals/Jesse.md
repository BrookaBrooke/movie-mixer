January 4th 2023:
Today was the first day of our project and none of us were familiar with FastAPI, so we all took most of the day talking things over and also going through the explorations and watching the videos to make sure we had a better understanding before getting started.

january 5th 2023:
Today we broke into two smaller groups. I was with Mike and Ben. I did the coding while Mike and Ben helped to guide me along and we made the POST and GET for movies.

january 6th 2023:
Set up the Routes and made a separate components folder for React, also made a Nav bar with drop-down menu and made a temporary Coming Soon homepage

january 9th 2023:
I started on the MovieDetail page in React, while each other group member also worked on a different page. I discussed possibly changing our MovieApi to get back some better quality picture data for front-end

january 10th 2023:
We decided to change the api, because it had better quality images and also backdrop images for each movie. We all helped Jalen walk through changing the api because this one was more difficult than our last API. There was a unique call for the images separately from the movie data, to keep the api more light. Then I continued working on the MovieDetail page to figure out how to retrieve the id from the MovieSearch page where the list of movies are and the Onclick to the detail page.

january 11th 2023:
Worked on css and started creating the Movie Detail page

january 12 2023:
continued to work on the MovieDetail page and worked on the html and css for it as well. Had issues with scaling to different resolutions so continued to find a solution.

january 13th 2023:
I added a movie trailer carousel on the homepage and also updated the css/html on the homepage search bar and made it transparent and did an overlay over the movie trailer carousel. I also fixed the white background on the search page when listing all movies you looked up. Me and Brooke also pair-programmed after lunch, she was the driver and I guided her creating part of the Register and UserContext page in react.

january 14th:
I finished the registration and got the token to work when registering your token was stored in localstorage and changed things in UserContext as well to get everything to work and prep'd to work on Log-in and authentication.

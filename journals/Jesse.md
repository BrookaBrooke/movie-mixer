January 4th 2023:
Today was the first day of our project and none of us were familiar with FastAPI, so we all took most of the day talking things over and also going through the explorations and watching the videos to make sure we had a better understanding before getting started.

january 5th 2023:
Today we broke into two smaller groups. I was with Mike and Ben. I did the coding while Mike and Ben helped to guide me along and we made the POST and GET for movies.

january 6th 2023:
Set up the Routes and made a separate components folder for React, also made a Nav bar with drop-down menu and made a temporary Coming Soon homepage

january 9th 2023:
I started on the MovieDetail page in React, while each other group member also worked on a different page. I discussed possibly changing our MovieApi to get back some better quality picture data for front-end

january 10th 2023:
We decided to change the api, because it had better quality images and also backdrop images for each movie. We all helped Jalen walk through changing the api because this one was more difficult than our last API. There was a unique call for the images separately from the movie data, to keep the api more light. Then I continued working on the MovieDetail page to figure out how to retrieve the id from the MovieSearch page where the list of movies are and the Onclick to the detail page.

Today we broke into two smaller groups. I was with Mike and Ben. I did the coding while Mike and Ben helped to guide me along and we made the POST and GET for movies.

Set up the Routes and made a separate components folder for React, also made a Nav bar with drop-down menu and made a temporary Coming Soon homepage

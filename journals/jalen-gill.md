Today was the first day of working on this project, and I was ready to get started with our idea. I didn't have much FastAPI experience yet, so the group decided to spend the day reviewing the videos on learn in order to learn more about FastAPI and be ready to start the project tomorrow.

It was our first day of committing code to the project. Our group split off into two different groups that worked on different features. I was paired with Brooke and she was the one coding while I was the one guiding her. We managed to set up some routes for users, which would allow us to start working on autherization later.

We had all learned about autherization during lecture today, so we decided as a group to work on it together to make sure everything related to autherization worked properly. After some time and a few bugs, we managed to get the feature working, meaning that we could be ready to utilize it in the front end when the time comes.

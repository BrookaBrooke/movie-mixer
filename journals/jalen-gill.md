Today was the first day of working on this project, and I was ready to get started with our idea. I didn't have much FastAPI experience yet, so the group decided to spend the day reviewing the videos on learn in order to learn more about FastAPI and be ready to start the project tomorrow.

It was our first day of committing code to the project. Our group split off into two different groups that worked on different features. I was paired with Brooke and she was the one coding while I was the one guiding her. We managed to set up some routes for users, which would allow us to start working on autherization later.

# January 6th 2023:
We had all learned about authorization during lecture today, so we decided as a group to work on it together to make sure everything related to autherization worked properly. After some time and a few bugs, we managed to get the feature working, meaning that we could be ready to utilize it in the front end when the time comes.

After getting authorization in the back end to work, we all decided to split up features on the front end to start working on. I chose to implement the search feature where we would make api calls to the OMDB API to get movie data for the user to look through. I got through a little bit of it, and managed to get movie titles to show up by the end of the day.

I continued to work on the search feature today, I realized that when you entered a query, it would only fetch the first 10 results, which would not be good for queries with hundreds of results. I decided to try to implement next page and previous page buttons. I managed to get them to work somewhat but there was a bug that was causing the buttons to sometimes do the opposite of what they were supposed to do.

# January 11th 2023:
I wanted to fix the next page and previous page buttons today, I solved that previous bug by making sure that the pagenumber had a state that oculd be updated and that it was hardcoded to send the user to page 1 whenever they submitted a query. With that out of the way, I turned my attention to adding bootstrap to make the search results more presentable.

# January 12th 2023:
Now that the search page was functional, I worked towards getting the results to show up in a grid. Since there were 20 results, I made 5 rows of 4 movies, each with a picture and a title. We had also planned to create detail pages for each movie, so I added a button under each result that would redirect them to this page.
